        <li>Prep: <strong>10 min</strong></li>
        <li>Cook: <strong>25 min</strong></li>
        <li>Total: <strong>35 min</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1-1/4 cups warm water (110* to 115*)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup canola oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In large bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in water; let stand for 5 minutes. Add oil and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time, until a soft dough forms.
        </li>
        <li>Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 2-3 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, cook beef and onion over medium heat until beef is no longer pink, breaking meat into crumbles; drain.
        </li>
        <li>Punch down dough; divide in half. Press each half into a greased 12-in. pizza pan. Combine the tomato sauce, oregano and basil; spread over each crust. Top with beef mixture, green pepper and cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Bake at 400Â° for 25-30 minutes or until crust is lightly browned.
        </li>
    </ol>
